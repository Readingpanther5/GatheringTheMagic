- [[Gerwin Fairwinds]] has sent us to get a golden box with the words [[Golden Vault]] on the front. 
	- It's in a storefront in the town proper ([[Seferan]])
	- We will have to pay for it, he hasn't given any guarantee other than his word
- [[L1TTL3M4N]] ventured into town alone, he's found the Golden Valet shop
- The rest of us arrived shortly after, [[Flynwan]] specifically worried for [[L1TTL3M4N]]
- For some reason, Golden Vault is misheard as Golden Valet very often and it rewrites itself in illusions at random
- General store has a golden [[Golden Valet]] box
- A magical effect is definitely changing Vault to Valet. 
- Isarrel has started feeling a pull from the magic censoring "Vault"
- Found the box, guy in an alley charged us 20GP for it
- The box compelled [[Rilista]] to go to the basement of the [[Prologue/Places/The Golden Vault|The Golden Vault]]
- Quest Ends
